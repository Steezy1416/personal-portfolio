# Personal Portfolio

## Overview

This is a personal portfolio build using React to showcase my work to potential employers.

## My goals are to...
* Successfuly create the portfolio using react components
* Be able to download my resume
* Be able to go my deployed projects and view their source code

## How it started...

<br>

To start getting an idea for the portfolio I made this wireframe using Apple's Freeform app

<br>

Throughout the project it mostly stayed true to the wireframe but during development I made changes that I thought would suit the portfolio better such as the color scheme, adding icons, and more

## Plans for the future 

<br>

I plan to add more to this portfolio and make more changes, for example the contact form can validate input already but it does not actually send the email yet and I would like to add that. Other changes I would like to make is update the projects to things im more proud of, update my resume, and maybe add more style changes.
